- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to convey trust and sophistication.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8FF) for a clean and modern feel.
- Accent color: Subtle gold (#FFD700) to highlight key elements and calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Roboto' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Open Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. Both are widely used and provide a professional look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist and consistent icons from a professional icon set (e.g., Font Awesome Pro, Material Design Icons). Ensure icons are easily recognizable and intuitive.
- Employ a grid-based layout for a structured and organized appearance. Ensure ample white space to avoid a cluttered look and improve readability.
- Incorporate subtle and purposeful animations (e.g., micro-interactions) to provide feedback and enhance user engagement without being distracting. Use animation to guide the user through the interface.
